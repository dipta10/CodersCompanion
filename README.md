## Coders' Companion:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### How to run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

**Tools**: I used **Firestore** to store data online. I used Firebases' **Cloud Functions** To split the client and server side for a small portion of the notification senction.<br>
I've changed the rules to `open` for some testing perposes. Onces it's done, the security issues will be resolved.
