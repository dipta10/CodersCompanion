Probem with DFS, when there's a self loop.

# This is a test post
Now here is my code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>

using namespace std;

const int mx = 1e5;
vector<int> adj[mx];

void dfs (source) {
    // ... rest of the code
}

int main() {
    dfs(some_node);

    reutrn 0;
}
```

1. I've done that.
1. And that as well

but nothing is working. I got help from [LoveExtendsCode](https://www.youtube.com/c/loveextendscode).
